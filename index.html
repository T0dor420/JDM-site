These cars often have unique characteristics, features, and specifications tailored to meet the preferences and regulations of Japanese consumers. JDM cars often feature distinctive design elements that cater to Japanese tastes. This can include sleeker body designs, unique trim levels, and special edition models not available in other markets.

This includes cutting-edge infotainment systems, safety features, and driver-assistance technologies that may debut in Japan before being introduced to other markets. Many JDM cars are equipped with engines optimized for efficiency and performance within Japan's strict emissions and fuel economy standards.
