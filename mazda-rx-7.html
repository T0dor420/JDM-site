        <font size="+2"<p>The Mazda RX-7 is a legendary sports car that gained popularity for its unique rotary engine and nimble handling. One of the defining features of the RX-7 is its rotary engine, specifically the Wankel rotary engine. Unlike conventional piston engines, rotary engines use a triangular rotor spinning within a housing to generate power. This design gives the RX-7 a distinct engine note and high-revving capabilities. Throughout its history, the RX-7 has been praised for its agile handling and responsive steering. The lightweight design and unique engine configuration contributed to its popularity in motorsports, including drifting and road racing. The RX-7 gained a strong following in automotive culture, appearing in video games, movies, and as a popular choice for tuning and modifications. Its distinctive rotary engine sound and sharp styling made it a standout in the sports car world. Despite being out of production since the early 2000s, the Mazda RX-7 remains a highly sought-after collector's car and continues to influence Mazda's approach to sports car design. Its rotary engine technology has left a lasting impact on automotive enthusiasts and engineers alike. Overall, the Mazda RX-7 is revered for its innovative engine design, exhilarating performance, and timeless appeal among sports car enthusiasts.</font>
